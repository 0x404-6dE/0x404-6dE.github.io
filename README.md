***tl;dr:** a future-internet is being built on Ethereum (+ SKALE)*
---

**Thanks to SKALE and many other open-source-software (OSS) efforts, an entire category of Ethereum blockchain applications ("dApps") are entering *the realm of the newly possible*. *Previously-infeasible* software-ideas (and implicated industries) could include: payment systems, coordination and governance tools,  composable "money lego" financial functions, and sandboxes for experimentation in economics / governance / profit-structures.**  Future-builders and hackers stand to benefit from an ever-expanding ecosystem of OSS "Web3" tools and integrations, which allow a single developer to combine (or modify) open-source primitives into new digital-systems which gain (often surprising) power from (open-source / unbreakable / arbitrary)  *business logic and agreements* ("Smart Contracts") and the ability to "engineer" incentives and align any number of individuals / organizations (even if anonymous or mutually-distrusting) over the internet. 
  
**Memewars is a "digital arena for meme-battles and viral sweepstakes" that will pay ad-revenue $$$ to site-users, digital artists, and user-voted causes** â€” it's also an example of a *previously infeasible dApp* enabled by new Web3 infastructure. **When a SKALE sidechain (as dApp *scalability* solution)** (tx/s throughput gains vs. *main-network Ethereum*, while retaining security) **is combined with an easy-onboarding solution like Torus** (* generate / manage a crypto-wallet by logging into a pre-existing reddit / $website account, and buy cryptocurrency in-app with debit card*), **a number of hurdles that have long plagued the prospect of *mainstream Ethereum adoption* suddenly seem surmountable...**

internet-experiment / Ethereum dApp â€” relies on SKALE

</h2>

- **Idea:** ***A digital "gladiator arena" for *meme-battles*** (a platform for 24/7 *viral-content sweepstakes*), **itself designed to go viral** *using fun + incentives.* **Will pay out $** (transparently) **to site users** (*spectators / voters / contestants*) and **artists / coders / translators / promoters / partners** who contribute to the *m_w universe* or otherwise ðŸš€ help memewars get big ðŸš€.

- **Context:** $150B+ in online-ad $ will be "earned" by social-media megacorps (ft. dusty and vampiric shareholders) in 2020. ***Internet ads derive their value from your (!) traffic, data, and memes*, yet TikTok / FB / $platform have never sent you a micro-crumb of revenue or platform ownership.** We could create...

- **Structure:** a *for-profit digital collective* that's doubles as a "public-good", re-directing online-ad revenue $$$ (USA total: $150B+ in 2019) to the (digital) wallets of [ "normal" internet-users / meme-lovers / digital artists / OSS / user-chosen causes / etc. ]. M_W will earn the aforementioned $$$ via [ on-site advertising | events | partnerships | integrations ] whose formats are interesting and fun (for ad-viewers) + direct and engaging (for advertisers). **More than anything, it's an internet experiment made possible by Web3, and you can own a % of the idea by helping m_w go viral.** Ownership incentives for [ users / potential-investors / internet-figures ]** will be announced before launch.

- **Unlocks an entire category of *use-cases* in "the space of possible dApps", especially Web3 (*platforms / structures / smart-contract systems* ) which promise some clear benefit (often: cost-savings / incentive-alignment / efficiency / data-control) over their closest "legacy" (Web 2 / centralized) *equivalents***, but which are *currently* infeasible *on mainnet Ethereum* due to network scalability limitations. The terms below (`slow` and `expensive`) are used in a *relative* sense â€” **m_w has massive respect and big <3 for an Ethereum that *currently* is**:

  - ***Quickly Congested***: Maximum of 15  tx/s (transactions per second). A transaction or digital signature (or both) is behind most"Web3" interactions (sending a token, invoking a smart-contract function, etc).   *For context: Visa claimed [a capacity for 56,000 tx/s in 2015](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visa-fact-sheet-Jun2015.pdf)*
  
  - ***Slow***: Minimum time needed to confirm a transaction is ~15 seconds (*blocktime*: average time-elapsed between finalized blocks. In other words: *longest possible duration before your tx can be "trusted" by other rational actors on Ethereum, after being sent from your computer*)	 
    
  - ***Expensive***: on-chain data-storage (permanently storing: user-content, interaction-history, mappings of Ethereum addresses to roles and balances) and computation (for example: a *for-loop* over a hypothetical 1M+ collection of user-profiles, registered in a `mapping` belonging to the smart-contracts of a given "dApp")

**Takeaway**: In addition to the technical gap filled by SKALE's platform, the team is composed of highly-skilled engineers who are a joy to collaborate with.
