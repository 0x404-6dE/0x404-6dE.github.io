***tl;dr:** a future-internet is being built on Ethereum (+ SKALE)*
---

**Thanks to SKALE and many other open-source-software (OSS) efforts, an entire category of Ethereum dApps are entering *the realm of the newly possible*. Possible applications include: payment systems, co-ordination and decision-making tools,  composable "money lego functions",  sandboxes for experiments in [ economics / governance / profit-structures / ... ].**  Builders and hackers stand to benefit from an ever-expanding ecosystem of OSS [ Ethereum / "Web3" ] tools + integrations, which allow an individual developer to create powerful digital-systems composed of cryptographically-guaranteed open-source rule-sets + agreements.
  
**Memewars is a "digital arena for meme-battles and viral sweepstakes" that will direct ad-revenue $$$ to site-users, and an member of the *previously infeasible dApp (+DAO)* category**. When a *scalability* solution like SKALE (allowing tx/s gains vs. *mainnet Ethereum* while retaining security) with a dead-easy onboarding solution like Torus** (* generate / use an Ethereum-wallet by logging into a reddit/fb/etc. account, and then easily buy cryptocurrency in-site with debit-card*), **a number of hurdles that have long plagued the promise of *mainstream Ethereum adoption* appear suddenly surmountable...**

</h2>

- **A digital "gladiator arena" for *meme-battles*** (a platform for 24/7 *viral-content sweep$takes*), **itself designed to go viral** *with fun + incentives.* **Pays out $** (transparently) **to site users** (*spectators / voters / contestants*) and **artists / coders / translators / promoters / early partners** who contribute to the *m_w universe* or otherwise ðŸš€ help m_w get big  ðŸš€.

- **Context:** $150B+ in online-ad $ will be "earned" by social-media megacorps (ft. dusty vampire shareholders) in 2020. **Internet ads derive their value from *your (!) traffic, data, and memes*, yet TikTok / FB / $platform has never sent you a micro-crumb of a dollar, or granted you a microscopic share of ownership. We could create...

- **Structure:** a *for-profit digital collective* that's also a *public-good*, directing $ from online-advertising-campaigns to the (digital) wallets of meme-lovers / digital artists / open-internet causes / "normal" people in a way that hasn't been tried (or possible) before. **Ownership incentives for [ users / potential-investors / internet-figures ]** will be announced before launch.

- **Unlocks an entire category of *use-cases* in "the space of possible dApps", especially Web3 (*platforms / structures / smart-contract systems* ) which promise some clear benefit (often: cost-savings / incentive-alignment / efficiency / data-control) over their closest "legacy" (Web 2 / centralized) *equivalents***, but which are *currently* infeasible *on mainnet Ethereum* due to network scalability limitations. The terms below (`slow` and `expensive`) are used in a *relative* sense â€” **m_w has massive respect and big <3 for an Ethereum that *currently* is**:

  - ***Quickly Congested***: Maximum of 15  tx/s (transactions per second). A transaction or digital signature (or both) is behind most"Web3" interactions (sending a token, invoking a smart-contract function, etc).   *For context: Visa claimed [a capacity for 56,000 tx/s in 2015](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visa-fact-sheet-Jun2015.pdf)*
  
  - ***Slow***: Minimum time needed to confirm a transaction is ~15 seconds (*blocktime*: average time-elapsed between finalized blocks. In other words: *longest possible duration before your tx can be "trusted" by other rational actors on Ethereum, after being sent from your computer*)	 
    
  - ***Expensive***: on-chain data-storage (permanently storing: user-content, interaction-history, mappings of Ethereum addresses to roles and balances) and computation (for example: a *for-loop* over a hypothetical 1M+ collection of user-profiles, registered in a `mapping` belonging to the smart-contracts of a given "dApp")

**Takeaway**: In addition to the technical gap filled by SKALE's platform, the team is composed of highly-skilled engineers who are a joy to collaborate with.
