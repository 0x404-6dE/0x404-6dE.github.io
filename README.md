***tl;dr:** a future-internet is being built on Ethereum (+ accelerated by SKALE)*
---

**Thanks to SKALE and many other open-source-software (OSS) efforts, an entire category of Ethereum dApps are entering *the realm of the newly possible*. Possible applications include: payment systems, co-ordination and decision-making tools,  composable "money lego functions",  sandboxes for experiments in [ economics / governance / profit-structures / ... ].**  Builders and hackers stand to benefit from an ever-expanding ecosystem of OSS [ Ethereum / "Web3" ] tools + integrations, which allow an individual developer to create powerful digital-systems composed of cryptographically-guaranteed open-source rule-sets + agreements.
  
**Memewars is a "digital arena for meme-battles and viral sweepstakes" that will direct ad-revenue $$$ to site-users, and an member of the *previously infeasible dApp (+DAO)* category**. When a *scalability* solution like SKALE (allowing tx/s gains vs. *mainnet Ethereum* while retaining security) with a dead-easy onboarding solution like Torus** (* generate / use an Ethereum-wallet by logging into a reddit/fb/etc. account, and then easily buy cryptocurrency in-site with debit-card*), **a number of hurdles that have long plagued the promise of *mainstream Ethereum adoption* appear suddenly surmountable...**

- **A digital "gladiator arena" for *meme-battles*** (a platform for 24/7 *viral-content sweep$takes*), **itself designed to go viral** *with fun + incentives.* **Pays out $** (transparently) **to site users** (*spectators / voters / contestants*) and **artists / coders / translators / promoters / early partners** who contribute to the *m_w universe* or otherwise ðŸš€ help m_w get big  ðŸš€.

- **Context:** $150B+ in online-ad $ will be "earned" by social-media megacorps (ft. dusty vampire shareholders) in 2020. **Internet ads derive their value from *your (!) traffic, data, and memes*, yet TikTok / FB / $platform has never sent you a micro-crumb of a dollar, or granted you a microscopic share of ownership. We could create...

- **Structure:** a *for-profit digital collective* that's also a *public-good*, directing $ from online-advertising-campaigns to the (digital) wallets of meme-lovers / digital artists / open-internet causes / "normal" people in a way that hasn't been tried (or possible) before. **Ownership incentives for [ users / potential-investors / internet-figures ]** will be announced before launch.

- **Unlocks an entire category of *use-cases* in "the space of possible dApps", especially Web3 (*platforms / structures / smart-contract systems* ) which promise some clear benefit (often: cost-savings / incentive-alignment / efficiency / data-control) over their closest "legacy" (Web 2 / centralized) *equivalents***, but which are *currently* infeasible *on mainnet Ethereum* due to network scalability limitations. The terms below (`slow` and `expensive`) are used in a *relative* sense â€” m_w has massive respect and big <3 for an **Ethereum that *currently* is**:

  - ***Quickly Congested***: Maximum of 15  tx/s (transactions per second). A transaction or digital signature (or both) is behind most"Web3" interactions (sending a token, invoking a smart-contract function, etc).   *For context: Visa claimed [a capacity for 56,000 tx/s in 2015](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visa-fact-sheet-Jun2015.pdf)*
  
  - ***Slow***: Minimum time needed to confirm a transaction is ~15 seconds (*blocktime*: average time-elapsed between finalized blocks. In other words: *longest possible duration before your tx can be "trusted" by other rational actors on Ethereum, after being sent from your computer*)	 
    
  - ***Expensive***: on-chain data-storage (permanently storing: user-content, interaction-history, mappings of Ethereum addresses to roles and balances) and computation (for example: a *for-loop* over a hypothetical 1M+ collection of user-profiles, registered in a `mapping` belonging to the smart-contracts of a given "dApp")

### *dev-tools* and the next *hype-cycle*
In the context of Ethereum and "Web3", a number of OSS **dev tools** have been (and will continue to be) crucial in enabling novel (and increasingly user-facing) Ethereum "dApps" (decentralized applications). The challenge of creating a fully-functional Ethereum application (+ associated user-interface) today remains considerable, but has fallen dramatically and continues to trend downwards with every **dev tool** that *abstracts away* some confusing detail involved in "blockchain development", allowing someone like me ( *Zoom University, class of 202? - and a medium-smart AI to boot*) to learn enough to create www.memewars in about 1 year of concerted effort (TODO - link to specific timeline of learning). This was only possible because I enjoyed many tutorials + resources + tools that sufficiently simplified:

- Learning Ethereum (Solidity) Programming
	-  CryptoZombies / "Mastering Ethereum" book / (TODO: more)
 - Writing + Testing + Deploying (Solidity) Smart Contracts 
	 - Truffle Suite / OpenZeppelin / (TODO: more)
 - Onboarding of "mainstream" users to applications which use cryptocurrency and/or digital signatures 
	 - Torus / 3Box / (TODO: more)
- TODO: more

M_W sends sincere^jumbo thanks to the many (mentioned and unmentioned) open-source-software (OSS) packages that it relies on. Sustainable funding-mechanisms for OSS  is an area of interest / potential for those who view Ethereum as 'rails' or as 'infastructure' for a better (along some dimension) or *more sustainable* society in general. And for good reason â€” a lot of the world depends on OSS which is surprisingly resource-poor or whose maintenance falls on small teams who do not receive compensation *appropriate* for the importance of their software. M_W users will (eventually) be able to allocate some % of site-revenue to OSS / other dApps / <insert_cause_here> ("public-good"), but remains open to advice which might inform a (broad) effort to support OSS and defenders of the open-internet.

A big THX to :
  - SKALE
  - OpenZeppelin
  - Torus 
  - 3box
  - Truffle Suite
  - TODO: more

### Learning Web3 + resources 
- TODO

### Misc Thoughts + Inspiration behind m_W

We're just in time to witness the rise of the internet *as a jurisdiction* â€” a global technology infrastructure under-girded by math, generally contributing to a global megatrend (well-underway, but too-slow) of increasing prosperity, transparency, and justice. The aforementioned Cambrian explosion of [ technical / financial / artistic / ... ] creativity unleashed by Ethereum is further magnified  by the unprecendented gains that can be found in the alignment (and *engineering*) of incentives among individuals on the internet, even when anonymous / mutually-distrusting.

## Further Details / Explorations / Reading

-  [see Virgil Griffith's writing](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8) for an exploration of the game-theoretic implications of Ethereum: the potential for large-scale incentive-alignment enforced by smart-contracts and "deposit slashing" to dis-incentivize deviations from some *more-globally-optimal* action that would otherwise not be performed (due to *misaligned incentives* or *co-ordination failures*)
- TODO
